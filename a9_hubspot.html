  <h1>Hubspot CRM & Breeze! </h1>
  </header>
<p>HubSpot is a U.S.-based software company that provides an all-in-one platform for inbound marketing, sales, and customer service. 
Founded in 2006, HubSpot’s mission is "to make the world more inbound," helping businesses attract and engage customers through useful content rather than intrusive ads. 
Over the years, HubSpot has expanded from a marketing tool into a complete customer relationship management (CRM) platform, including Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and Service Hub, all built around a unified Smart CRM.
</p>
<p>Today, HubSpot is widely used by over <strong>248,000 customers in 135+ countries</strong>. Its reputation as an intuitive, easy-to-use CRM makes it a favorite among small and mid-sized businesses. 
Unlike some enterprise CRMs that require dedicated IT teams, HubSpot is known for its simple implementation, strong integrations, and its HubSpot Academy, which offers free training to help users maximize the platform.
