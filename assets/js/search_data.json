Additionally, another AI tool, Homer, automates the creation of product descriptions, demonstrating AI's role in streamlining internal content generation.
Bloomreach (B2B SaaS) – To scale its content marketing efforts, Bloomreach equipped its four-person team with an AI writing assistant (Jasper).

This allowed them to expand content distribution without increasing headcount while focusing on high-level SEO strategy and creative work.
